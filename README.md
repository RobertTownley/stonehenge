# stonehenge

A modern and opinionated web framework for python

## Intro

Stonehenge is a framework for building websites and APIs using Python. It takes significant inspiration from Django's
opinionated approach to web development, while offering support for modern python utils, such as type hints and
asyncronous request handling.

## Goodies

Some things that developers coming from other frameworks may appreciate:

### A built-in ORM with migration support

### Support for async views

### Built with type hints from the ground up, for improved editor support

### An included admin interface and CMS for static page management

### An ergonomic API for configuring and architecting web apps

### Support for token and HTTP-Cookie authentication strategies
